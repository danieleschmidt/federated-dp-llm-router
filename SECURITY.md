## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid exposing users to unnecessary risk.

### 2. Contact our security team
Send an email to: **security@terragonlabs.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### 3. Use PGP encryption (recommended)
For sensitive vulnerability reports, please use our PGP key:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key would be here in production]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### 4. Response timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution target**: 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for others

### 5. Disclosure policy
We follow coordinated disclosure:
- We will work with you to understand and validate the issue
- We will develop and test a fix
- We will prepare a security advisory
- We will coordinate the public disclosure timing

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### 1. Network Configuration
```yaml
# Recommended firewall rules
- Allow: TCP/443 (HTTPS) from authorized subnets only
- Allow: TCP/8443 (Node communication) from federated network only  
- Deny: All other inbound traffic
- Enable: DDoS protection and rate limiting
```

### 2. Certificate Management
```bash
# Generate certificates with proper key sizes
openssl genrsa -out private.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -key private.key -out certificate.crt -days 365

# Use certificate pinning for critical connections
# Rotate certificates every 90 days
# Store private keys in hardware security modules (HSM)
```

### 3. Environment Variables
```bash
# Use strong, unique secrets
export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)
export ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export DATABASE_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Never use default passwords in production
# Store secrets in dedicated secret management systems
```

### 4. Privacy Configuration
```yaml
privacy:
  epsilon_per_query: 0.1  # Adjust based on privacy requirements
  delta: 1.0e-5          # Keep small for strong privacy
  max_budget_per_user: 10.0  # Enforce daily limits
  noise_multiplier: 1.1   # Higher = more privacy, less utility
  composition: "rdp"      # Use RDP for tighter bounds
```

### 5. Monitoring Setup
```yaml
monitoring:
  enable_audit_logging: true
  audit_retention_days: 2555  # 7 years for HIPAA
  enable_real_time_alerts: true
  security_monitoring: true
  anomaly_detection: true
```

## Security Testing

### 1. Automated Security Testing
We use multiple tools for automated security testing:

```bash
# Static analysis
bandit -r federated_dp_llm/
safety check
semgrep --config=auto

# Dependency scanning  
pip-audit
snyk test

# Container scanning
docker scan federated-dp-llm:latest
```

### 2. Penetration Testing
- Annual third-party penetration testing
- Regular internal security assessments
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Red team exercises for critical deployments

### 3. Privacy Testing
```python
# Example privacy test
def test_differential_privacy_guarantee():
    # Test that mechanism satisfies (ε, δ)-DP
    mechanism = GaussianMechanism(delta=1e-5)
    
    # Privacy test with adjacent datasets
    dataset1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    dataset2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]  # Adjacent (differ by 1 record)
    
    # Test privacy guarantee holds
    assert privacy_test(mechanism, dataset1, dataset2, epsilon=0.1, delta=1e-5)
```

## Incident Response

### 1. Security Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Data breach, authentication bypass, remote code execution
- **High**: Privilege escalation, significant data exposure
- **Medium**: Denial of service, information disclosure
- **Low**: Security misconfigurations, minor vulnerabilities

### 2. Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts or manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope, impact, and classification
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and prevent spread
4. **Investigation**: Forensic analysis and root cause identification
5. **Recovery**: Restore services and implement fixes
6. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders and regulatory bodies
7. **Post-mortem**: Document lessons learned and improve processes

### 3. Contact Information
